1 - Level System
    Level 0 is used for the main menu bgm and map "Mostly Ignored"
2 - Music System
    For the music just type the location of the audio file just like the way it'S 
    done in the json file
3 - Map System
    
    the map system is split into two parts

    1-the player interaction
        this part defines what happens when the player attempts to enter a block
        but does not control how the block will render 
        and the array responsible for defining this is the map array
        so when -for example- you put a 0 inside a block
        you don't actually draw a wall but you define that the player can't walk there
        similarly when you put 1 it defines that the player should power up when he enter's the block

        -Codes-
        Pacman.WALL = 0
        Pacman.BISCUIT = 1
        Pacman.EMPTY = 2
        Pacman.BLOCK = 3
        Pacman.PILL = 4

    2-the map drawing
        the map drawing is done in two parts 
        first the wall drawing which is done in the wall array
        the wall drawing is done manually which means that you define how the map should render
        how ? 
        well first you should start by an empty array like this
        //
        "walls": [
            
          ],
        //
        now each walls array consists of a bunch of instruction sets you define the instruction set using []
        and inside the instruction set you can have as many instructions as you need defined by
        {} as follows 
        //
        "walls": [
            [
              { "instruction 1": [arguments] },
              { "instruction 2": [arg 1, arg 2, arg 3, arg 4] },
            ],
          ],
        //
        there are only three instructions
        //
        "walls": [
            [
              { "move": [x, y] },
              { "line": [x, y] },
              { "curve": [Cx, Cy, x, y] },
            ],
          ],
        //
        you may notice something strange how can you draw a line with one point ?
        and a curve with only two points ?
        and what about the move instruction what does that do ?

        well first the line takes the coordinates of one point which is the end point
        what about the first point ?
        well the start is actually taken from the last point that was drawn to if this is the first time to draw
        then the start point will default to zero, zero

        and the same thing goes for the curve the x and y are for the end point and the start point
        is taken from the last point that was drawn to the control point is used to define the curveture
        
        well what if i don't want to start the line from the last point 
        well that's what the move instruction does
        it changes the last point to the point provided so you can start the line from wherever you want

        second is the automatic drawing
        the only thing you have to draw are lines the rest is handeled automatically
        but make sure you don't draw a wall over a non wall block or the automatic system will override your command 
        and you won't see that block so be careful
    
    now the map size is 19x22 so keep that in mind when you put the coordinates in the instruction or
    when setting the blocks in the map array

4 - Ghost System
    Each Object in the ghosts array represents a ghosts (there are as many ghosts as there are
    objects in the array)

    each object has to have an img attribute if left empty will use the default ghost renderer

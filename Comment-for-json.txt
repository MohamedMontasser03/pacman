1 - Level System
    Level 0 is used for the main menu bgm and map "Mostly Ignored"
2 - Music System
    For the music just type the location of the audio file just like the way it'S 
    done in the json file
3 - Map System
    1 - the map matrix
      the map matrix is 19x22
      where each number represents the corresponding BLOCK
      ------
      WALL = 0
      BISCUIT = 1
      EMPTY = 2
      BLOCK = 3
      PILL = 4
      ------
      (note that if you set a block to wall it won't draw a wall but the player won't be able to move through the block)
    2 - the wall matrix
      the wall matrix is used to draw the walls and it uses the 19x22 coordinates 
      (because there are three different types of coordinate systems in this game and i don't know the point)
      so if you write 
      "line": [0.5, 18.5]
      it will draw a line from your current point to point 0.5, 18.5
      and you change your current location with the move command
      
      as for the curves you just define the two points at the ends of the curve and it draws it
      and you'll get used to the system quickly when you use it
4 - Ghost System
    Each Object in the ghosts array represents a ghosts (there are as many ghosts as there are
    objects in the array)

    each object has to have an img attribute if left empty will use the default ghost renderer
